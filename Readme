🚀 README: Color & Size Configuration Script
This is a configuration script written in Python that guides a user through selecting an item's color style (simple or gradient) and size (predefined or custom) via a dynamic command-line interface.
The program features a visually enhanced ("dashing") terminal experience with color-coded prompts and a stylish entry banner.
✨ Features
 * Dashing Interface: Uses ANSI escape codes and emojis for a visually appealing, easy-to-read console experience.
 * Color Choice: Users can select between a Simple Color (single hue) or a Gradient Color (start/end colors).
 * Size Choice: Users can choose from predefined sizes (Small, Medium, Large) or input a Custom Size value.
 * Exit Option: The user can gracefully exit the program (X) at any prompt.
 * Startup Banner: Greets the user with a large "HACKITON" ASCII art banner using the pyfiglet library.
🛠️ Requirements
To run this script, you must have Python installed and need the pyfiglet library for the startup banner.
 * Install Python: (If not already installed)
 * Install pyfiglet:
<!-- end list -->
pip install pyfiglet

💻 How to Run
 * Save the code as a Python file (e.g., config_script.py).
 * Open your terminal or command prompt.
 * Execute the script:
<!-- end list -->
python config_script.py

📜 Code Overview
The script is structured into functions for clarity:
 * Colors Class: Defines constants for ANSI color codes.
 * print_banner("HACKITON"): Displays the custom ASCII art at startup.
 * handle_exit_choice(choice): Checks for the 'X' input and uses sys.exit() to terminate the program.
 * get_user_preferences_dashing(): Contains the main menu loops for color and size input.
